# Driver-Drowsiness

## Problem Statement 
<p>Driver drowsiness is a critical issue that directly impacts road safety and is a major cause of traffic accidents worldwide. With drivers becoming fatigued, the ability to remain alert while on the road diminishes, leading to slower reaction times and impaired decision-making. As such, detecting signs of drowsiness in drivers can play a pivotal role in preventing these accidents, saving lives, and reducing the economic burden caused by road incidents. Image classification offers an effective method to address this problem, as visual cues such as facial expressions, eye movements, and head orientation are strong indicators of driver alertness. Using image processing techniques to classify these signs can serve as an early warning system to detect drowsy drivers in real time.</p>
